Setup Rentals Data in Cloud SQL
In this lab, you'll configure and deploy Linux instances with web servers on them, by Cloud Platform Console (to see all options) and gcloud to gain experience with the command-line (to script commands).

Then, you'll create a disk snapshot for regular backups and a custom image for creating new instances.

These tasks are especially useful for lift-and-shift operations that may require specific hardware or software configurations.
